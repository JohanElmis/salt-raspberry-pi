* Pi and root user password configuration (remove passwords?)

  * There's an issue of ``Permission denied, no authentication information``
    when trying to run the ``pi.common.user`` state with the state ID as
    anything but the user ID (eg "remove password for pi").

* Configuration extracted from @davidjb's existing Pis:

  * Camera Pi
  * OpenSprinkler Pi
